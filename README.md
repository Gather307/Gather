## Gather ( NOT SURE WHICH ONE OF THESE DESCRIPTIONS WE PREFER )

Gather is for individuals who need a way to keep track of items when planning large events like a party or family gathering, moving to a new house, or going on a trip. Gather is a digital inventory management website that helps maintain, share, and organize multiple peopleâ€™s items. Unlike traditional inventory management sites and check-off list tools that are designed for either an individual or a larger corporation, our product is made for both individuals and small groups of friends and family making it more friendly and easier to collaborate and communicate who has what items through integrated group functionalities.

To allow students to keep track of their items after moving to college and organize the purchasing of items with their roommates!

## UML Diagram

Create a wikipage (.md file) on your GitHub repository for the UML Class Diagram you have produced. Include the date the diagrams were last updated. Link to this page from your project README file. Also, push the source files of your diagram to the repo. I suggest you create a docs folder for the sake of organization.
